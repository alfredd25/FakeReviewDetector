 
# Fake Review Detector

A Chrome extension that uses Machine Learning to detect and highlight potentially fake reviews on platforms like Amazon, Yelp, and TripAdvisor.

## Features

- Automatically scans and analyzes reviews on supported websites
- Highlights potentially fake reviews with color indicators:
  - **Red**: High confidence (90%+) that the review is fake
  - **Orange**: Uncertain but suspicious reviews
  - **Green**: Verified as genuine with high confidence.
- Provides a popup interface to manually check specific reviews

## Architecture

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Machine Learning Backend**: A Naive Bayes classifier trained on datasets of real and fake reviews, exposed via Flask API.
2. **Chrome Extension**: Injects JavaScript to identify, process, and highlight reviews based on the ML model's predictions.

## Project Status
